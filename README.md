# **Iftar Party - Learning HTML, CSS & JavaScript through a Project-Based Approach**  

## **About This Project**  
This repository is part of my journey to learn **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** by building a fun and interactive project. Instead of just going through theory, I created an **Iftar Party** webpage to apply core web development concepts in a hands-on way. It is designed to showcase an interactive invitation page for an Iftar gathering. This project helped me understand the structure of web pages, styling techniques, and adding interactivity using JavaScript.  

## **What I Learned**  
âœ… **HTML** â€“ Structuring content with semantic elements like `<header>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, etc.  
âœ… **CSS** â€“ Styling layouts, using Flexbox, colors, fonts, and making the page responsive.  
âœ… **JavaScript** â€“ Handling events, DOM manipulation, and adding dynamic elements.  

## **Project Features**  
- ðŸ“Œ **Event Invitation UI** â€“ A simple yet engaging Iftar invitation page.  
- ðŸŽ¨ **Styled with CSS** â€“ Custom-designed layout with modern styling techniques.  
- ðŸŽ¯ **Interactive Elements** â€“ Buttons and real-time updates using JavaScript.  
- ðŸ“± **Responsive Design** â€“ Adapts to different screen sizes.  

## **Tech Stack Used**  
- **HTML5** â€“ Structure & Content  
- **CSS3** â€“ Styling & Layout  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla JS)** â€“ Interactivity  



## **Why This Project?**  
I built this project to **reinforce fundamental web development skills** through a practical approach. Itâ€™s not just about writing codeâ€”it's about understanding **how the web works** and creating real-world applications.
